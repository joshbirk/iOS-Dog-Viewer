<h1>iOS Dog Viewer</h1>

This is the finished code that I did for CloudStock San Fran '11, and the partially the "5 minute iOS app" demo as well.  Slightly more complete example of using the iOS SDK, including error handling, going into a detail page (with a XIB), accessing picklist values and displaying them, and updating a record.

Obviously requires the Mobile SDK - check it out at http://developer.force.com/mobilesdk.

Catch me on twitter @joshbirk if you've got other ?'s.
